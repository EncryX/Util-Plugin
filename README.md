Hey everyone!
Plugin: [Encry's Utils](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/98058081444017/Encrys-Utils)
Or github if roblox doesnt work: [Github Plugin](https://github.com/EncryX/Util-Plugin)

I’ve been working on a small utility plugin to make inserting models and modules into Studio much easier and faster — and I thought I’d share it here!

### Main Features

**1. Magic Select Tool**
Quickly and intelligently bulk-select multiple objects at once! Perfect for when you need to grab a bunch of modules, parts, or grouped assets without manually clicking through everything.

**2. Insert Tool**
Browse and insert from a growing library of modules — from well-known community libraries to smaller hidden gems.
Each library/module includes full credit to its original creator.

### Ongoing Updates

I’ll be updating this plugin **weekly** with:

* New modules and libraries
* Improvements to existing ones
* Bug fixes and optimizations

### Feedback & Suggestions

I’d love to hear your thoughts!
Are there specific modules or tools you’d like to see added?
Any quality-of-life improvements or features you think would make it even better?

### Latest Update:

## V1.2.2
- Added a new feature for codifying (still in beta)
- Added some more libraries 
- Overall improvements and bug fixes

Latest updates found on [github](https://github.com/EncryX/Util-Plugin) and [marketplace](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/98058081444017/Encrys-Utils)! Any of these 2 sources are official.
