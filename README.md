# Util-Plugin

Hey everyone!
Plugin: [Encry's Utils](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/98058081444017/Encrys-Utils)

I’ve been working on a small utility plugin to make inserting models and modules into Studio much easier and faster — and I thought I’d share it here!

### Installation 

To install this plugin into your roblox client you must install it from the roblox creator store. Or manually install the rbxm file into your local plugins folder!

### Main Features

**1. Magic Select Tool**
Quickly and intelligently bulk-select multiple objects at once! Perfect for when you need to grab a bunch of modules, parts, or grouped assets without manually clicking through everything.

**2. Insert Tool**
Browse and insert from a growing library of modules — from well-known community libraries to smaller hidden gems.
Each library/module includes full credit to its original creator.

### Ongoing Updates

I’ll be updating this plugin **weekly** with:

* New modules and libraries
* Improvements to existing ones
* Bug fixes and optimizations
